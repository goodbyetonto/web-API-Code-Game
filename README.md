# web-API-Code-Game
Week 4 HW

Unfortunately, this is not a working app at this time. While I did spend a good deal of time working on this, I was distracted by trying to implement features that were not required for the assignment and ended up losing time on fullfilling the basic requirements. 

However, there were some lessons learned here. While speaking with Brian about this last Saturday, he introduced me to the term MVP, which I had not heard before in the context of software development. He encouraged me to focus on creating a MVP before worrying about cool features and things of that nature. Moving forward, I will put more emphasis on this. 

So you understand what you are looking at, my commits over the last several days were an effort on my part to approach this assignment with a more practical implementation of JS Objects. Initially, I was lumping all questions, answers and correct answers into a single object. Next, I was trying to implement a feature where the question order would be randomized. I felt that should someone want to retake the quiz, it would be too easy to memorize the order, so it just made it more 'real-to-life' IMO. However, this randomizing lead me to brick wall that I was having a hard time taking down. 

During Saturday's office hours, Brian suggested that I not worry about it now, but that I should consider re-writing it so that each question was its own object. So the code towards the top is my attempt at this. I was also able to get the timer to work and I did see that it was decrementing by 10 should the respondent give a wrong answer, however my program flow was such that how I ended up manipulating the DOM created some interesting timer behaviors that did not meet the requirments of the assignment. 

All in all, I have to know when to let go of something, and I felt that I could no longer continue to pour time into this assignment with another one due this Saturday and so I had to just stop working on this one. I would appreciate your feedback however and I hope I can return to it at some point to make it better.
